## History
>The idea behind this portfolio is to create an organized and visually striking page, that stands out for its cool colours and animations, that is why for this concept I chose black as the background colour, it is going to have a very galactic or space style, I was thinking in creating a more striking background but I want my work to be what visually attracts the most attention. For now, everything is subject to change...
